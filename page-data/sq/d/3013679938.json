{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"pathPrefix":"","siteUrl":"https://tc-imba.github.io","title":"Yihao Liu","description":"Personal Website of Yihao Liu","author":"Yihao Liu","authorAlternative":"刘逸灏","introduction":["I'm currently a Ph.D student in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I'm an graduate researcher in [SCALE](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scale/about-us) lab, supervised by Prof. Tang Xueyan, currently working on Algorithms in Multi-Agent Systems.","Despite my current research topic, my research interest spread widely in operating systems, distributed systems, network security and algorithms. \"Practice is the sole criterion of truth\", I would like to build effective systems and platforms for researchers, developers and the community. I'm ready to contribute to any small improvement of the infrastructure.","Besides a researcher, I started my life as a programmer and developer quite early. I learned C/C++ and attended NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces) in China and it becomes my most confident language. I developed my interest in other fields in computer science when I tried to find out what exactly happened behind these code I wrote. I was deeply attracted by the open source community and became an active developer in many projects as well.","Learning is the passion of my life, learning new knowledge in different fields, learning new programming languages, frameworks and features, and even learning how to play games all inspire me. My passion in learning can be witnessed by my proficiency in various OSs and programming languages. I'm always curious about the latest language features of C++ and Python; I helped the development of many Java projects, from Swagger API to Minecraft Mods; I developed and maintained web services across many types of Linux distributions during my undergraduate study; I can process data science (my undergraduate minor) tasks in scientific Python, MATLAB, Julia, and Mathematica; I'm also broadening my language family by learning some new ones such as Go and Rust.","As a fullstack developer skilled in Python, Javascript (React), SQL, CSS and many others, I built the theme of this website with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). The theme is named \"gatsby-theme-academic\", which is specially designed for academic usage by researchers and students. It is still under development and will be open-sourced soon, please check this [post](/posts/hello-world) for details."],"avatar":"avatar.png","professions":["Ph.D Student","Full Stack Developer"],"tocMaxDepth":2,"excerptMaxLength":500,"birthday":"June 15, 1997","location":"Singapore","email":"liuyh970615@gmail.com","postsForArchivePage":3,"social":[{"url":"/resume.pdf","icon":["ai","cv"]},{"url":"https://github.com/tc-imba","icon":["fab","github"]},{"url":"https://twitter.com/liuyh615","icon":["fab","twitter"]}],"disqusScript":"https://tc-imba.disqus.com/embed.js","contactFormUrl":"https://getform.io/f/09a3066f-c638-40db-ad59-05e4ed71e451","pages":{"home":"/","posts":"posts","contact":"contact","resume":"resume","tags":"tags","research":"research"},"wakatime":{"username":"tcimba","activity":"7add4047-08f9-4da8-b649-aa114503678f","language":"460a84ab-722a-4b80-b896-cabaa13ad7eb","editor":"d851639a-28d8-4884-949f-d338a858f7e9","os":"caf7d0d1-8fd2-4595-a991-363c8583fea9"},"interests":[{"icon":["fas","cubes"],"title":"Distributed Systems"},{"icon":["fab","docker"],"title":"Containerization"},{"icon":["fas","layer-group"],"title":"Full Stack Development"},{"icon":["fab","linux"],"title":"Open Source Community"}],"education":[{"date":"Jan 2020 - Present","icon":["fas","graduation-cap"],"title":"Ph.D in Computer Science","location":"Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"},{"date":"Sept 2017 - Aug 2021","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"(Second) B.S. in Applied Mathematics","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"},{"date":"Sept 2015 - Aug 2019","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"B.S.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with Minor in Data Science)","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"},{"date":"Sept 2008 - June 2015","icon":["fas","school"],"title":"Middle School","location":"Shanghai Southwest Weiyu Middle School, China"}],"experience":[{"title":"Teaching","position":"right","data":[{"date":"Summer 2019","title":"Teaching Assistant","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":"VE572 (Methods and Tools for Big Data)"},{"date":"Fall 2018","title":"Teaching Assistant","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":"VE482 (Introduction to Operating Systems)"},{"date":"Fall 2018","title":"Teaching Assistant","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":"VE281 (Data Structures and Algorithms)"},{"date":"Summer 2019","title":"Teaching Assistant","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":"VE280 (Programming and Elementary Data Structures)"},{"date":"Summer 2018","title":"Teaching Assistant","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":"VG101 (Introduction to Computer and Programming)"}]},{"title":"Open Source Community","position":"left","data":[{"date":"Fall 2018 - Present","title":"Leader and Fullstack Developer","location":"on GitHub","description":"[Joint Online Judge](https://github.com/joint-online-judge): Open source code judging and evaluation platform powered by async programming, containerization and modern frontend"},{"date":"2021 - Present","title":"Researcher and Backend Developer","location":"on GitHub","description":"[Brick Schema Example Server](https://github.com/BrickSchema/brick-example-server): Open-source ontology for building assets, subsystems and data"}]}],"awards":[{"date":"Nov 2019","title":"NTU Research Scholarship"},{"date":"Feb 2019","title":"Meritorious Winner in Mathematical Contest In Modeling"}],"tags":[{"id":"javascript","name":"javascript","description":"JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to give functionality to web pages.","color":"#f0da50"},{"id":"nodejs","name":"Node.js","description":"Node.js is a tool for executing JavaScript in a variety of environments.","color":"#90c53f"},{"id":"rxjs","name":"RxJS","description":"RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, for asynchronous operations.","color":"#eb428e"},{"id":"typescript","name":"typescript","description":"TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.","color":"#257acc"},{"id":"reactjs","name":"reactjs","description":"React is an open source JavaScript library used for designing user interfaces.","color":"#61dbfa"},{"id":"gatsby","name":"Gatsby.js","description":"A framework built over ReactJS to generate static page web application.
