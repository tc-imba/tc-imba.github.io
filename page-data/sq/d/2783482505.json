Existing approaches to multi-agent pickup and delivery typically address task assignment and path planning separately. We take an integrated approach that assigns and plans one task at a time taking into account the agent states resulting from all the previous task assignments and path planning. We define metrics to effectively determine which task is most worth assignment next and which agent ought to execute a given task, and propose a priority-based framework for joint task assignment and path planning. We leverage the bounding and pruning techniques in the proposed framework to greatly improve computational efficiency. We also refine the dummy path method for collision-free path planning. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by extensive experiments.","selected":true,"priority":0,"links":[{"name":"pdf","url":null},{"name":"extended abstract","url":null},{"name":"code","url":"https://github.com/tc-imba/MAPD-TD"}]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/tc-imba.github.io/tc-imba.github.io/content/research/mapd-deadline/index.md"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8df04c8ddd2f94f0d9d73d5e6e40fc82/3ea76/preview.png","srcSet":"/static/8df04c8ddd2f94f0d9d73d5e6e40fc82/3ea76/preview.png 320w,\n/static/8df04c8ddd2f94f0d9d73d5e6e40fc82/5a45b/preview.png 547w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8df04c8ddd2f94f0d9d73d5e6e40fc82/4a8d5/preview.webp 320w,\n/static/8df04c8ddd2f94f0d9d73d5e6e40fc82/d04f5/preview.webp 547w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":180}}},"date":"Oct 2020 - Present","venue":"","authors":[],"path":"research/brick","title":"Playground: A Safe Building Operating","tags":["os","building"],"excerpt":"Building operating systems are an emerging class of system software that provides services to applications running on commercial buildings. The current state-of-the-art requires applications to be trusted and carefully monitored due to a lack of authorization, access control, and execution isolation mechanisms in existing building operating systems. Proposed solutions do not adequately handle the complexity and scale of modern buildings, therefore impeding the adoption of applications that can enhance energy efficiency, occupant health, comfort, and productivity. This work explores the execution of **untrusted** user-facing applications in smart building environments with a focus on maintenance and management labor costs, ensuring the practicality and long-term sustainability of adopting such applications. We develop an operating system abstraction for smart buildings, \\name, that incorporates a structured semantic representation of the building to inform the safe, multi-tenant execution of untrusted applications. We use the semantic representation to implement (a) a novel graph-based capability mechanism for fine-grained and expressive access control management, and (b) a resource isolation mechanism with preemptive interventions and passive telemetry-based live resource monitoring. We demonstrate \\name on several real applications in a real building.","selected":true,"priority":0,"links":[{"name":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/BrickSchema"},{"name":"code","url":"https://github.com/BrickSchema/brick-example-server"}]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/tc-imba.github.io/tc-imba.github.io/content/research/brick/index.md"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":null,"date":"Jan 2023 - Present","venue":"","authors":[],"path":"research/mapf-countinuous","title":"Robust Continuous-Time Multi-Agent Path Execution","tags":["scheduling","algorithm"],"excerpt":"Most prior work on multi-agent path finding and execution has assumed that time is discretized into timesteps and the agents move in grid maps with uniform action durations. However, in real-world multi-agent applications, agents of different shapes can move in arbitrary directions, and unforeseen failures and anomalies can cause unexpected delays of the agents. These delays are difficult to model and predict, and they can break the assumptions made in path planning and degrade the effectiveness of path execution. This paper studies robust and effective execution of continuous-time multi-agent path plans. We define a feasibility problem of whether a path plan (or a leftover portion of it) can be successfully executed and propose an algorithm to solve it. We further develop offline and online algorithms to coordinate the agents, where conflict-freeness and deadlock-freeness are guaranteed during the path execution.","selected":true,"priority":0,"links":[]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/tc-imba.github.io/tc-imba.github.io/content/research/mapf-continuous/index.md"}}]}}}
