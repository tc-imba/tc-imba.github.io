We take an integrated approach that assigns and plans one task at a time taking into account the agent states resulting from all the previous task assignments and path planning. We define metrics to effectively determine which task is most worth assignment next and which agent ought to execute a given task, and propose a priority-based framework for joint task assignment and path planning.
