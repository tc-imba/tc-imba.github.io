It still lacks of documentation and many features are keep changing. \n\nWhen I opened the project with public access on GitHub at first, it is forked and tried by some of my followers, which make me quite embarrassed since it's buggy and hard to use at that time. I'm keep implementing new features and fixing issues found by some insiders. I'll make it public once everything is done.\n\n\n","htmlEncrypted":"","nonce":"","timeToRead":null,"title":"Hello World - My first blog","date":"1601596800000","tags":["blog"],"path":"posts/hello-world","excerpt":"I started to build this personal website yesterday.","links":[],"commit":0,"type":"posts"}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/tc-imba.github.io/tc-imba.github.io/content/posts/2020-10-02-Hello-World/index.md"}}},"pageContext":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/tc-imba.github.io/tc-imba.github.io/content/posts/2020-10-02-Hello-World/index.md","postPath":"posts/hello-world","translations":[{"hreflang":"en","path":"/posts/hello-world"}],"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World - My first blog","tags":["blog"],"date":"2020-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","path":"posts/hello-world","excerpt":"I started to build this personal website yesterday."}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1552981879","2158328490","3013679938"],"slicesMap":{}}
