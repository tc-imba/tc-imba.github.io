However, in real-world multi-agent applications, agents of different shapes can move in arbitrary directions, and unforeseen failures and anomalies can cause unexpected delays of the agents. These delays are difficult to model and predict, and they can break the assumptions made in path planning and degrade the effectiveness of path execution. This paper studies robust and effective execution of continuous-time multi-agent path plans. We define a feasibility problem of whether a path plan (or a leftover portion of it) can be successfully executed and propose an algorithm to solve it. We further develop offline and online algorithms to coordinate the agents, where conflict-freeness and deadlock-freeness are guaranteed during the path execution.","links":[],"type":"research"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":null,"date":"Jan 2022 - Present","venue":"AAMAS 2023 (Extended Abstract)","authors":["Saravanan Ramanathan","<u>Yihao Liu</u>","Xueyan Tang","Wentong Cai","Jingning Li"],"path":"research/mapd-tardness","title":"Minimising Task Tardiness for Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery","tags":["scheduling","algorithm"],"excerpt":"Multi-agent pickup and delivery,a variant of the multi-agent path finding problem, aims to find collision-free paths for a set of agents performing a continuous stream of pickup and delivery tasks. Owing to the service guarantee nature of applications, these agents of ten need to execute the tasks within their stipulated deadlines. When failure to meet task deadlines is unavoidable, there is a need to minimise the tardiness experienced by the tasks. To address this  problem, we propose a cost-based integrated task assignment and path planning algorithm to assign tasks to the agents.","links":[{"name":"extended abstract","url":null}],"type":"research"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":null,"date":"Jan 2022 - Dec 2022","venue":"","authors":[],"path":"research/mapf-uncertainty","title":"Multi-Agent Path Execution with Uncertainty","tags":["scheduling","algorithm"],"excerpt":"In real-world multi-agent applications, unexpected conditions can break the assumptions made in path planning and degrade the effectiveness of path execution.

Existing approaches to multi-agent pickup and delivery typically address task assignment and path planning separately. We take an integrated approach that assigns and plans one task at a time taking into account the agent states resulting from all the previous task assignments and path planning. We define metrics to effectively determine which task is most worth assignment next and which agent ought to execute a given task, and propose a priority-based framework for joint task assignment and path planning. We leverage the bounding and pruning techniques in the proposed framework to greatly improve computational efficiency. We also refine the dummy path method for collision-free path planning. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by extensive experiments.","links":[{"name":"pdf","url":null},{"name":"extended abstract","url":null},{"name":"code","url":"https://github.com/tc-imba/MAPD-TD"}],"type":"research"}}}]},"allFile":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"fileAbsolutePath":"","tag":"algorithm"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1552981879","2158328490","3013679938"],"slicesMap":{}}
